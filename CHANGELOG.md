## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.6](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mkv/compare/v0.0.5...v0.0.6) - 2026-05-04

### Other

- emit SeekHead at top of Segment for Info / Tracks / Cues
- surface subtitle tracks with MediaType::Subtitle + map S_* codec ids
- surface Matroska Attachments in metadata
- surface Matroska Chapters in metadata
- replace never-match regex with semver_check = false
- migrate to centralized OxideAV/.github reusable workflows
- pin release-plz to patch-only bumps

### Added

- mux: emit `SeekHead` at the top of the Segment with Seek entries for
  Info, Tracks, and Cues. Players that pre-walk the SeekHead (mpv,
  Chromium) can now jump to Cues without scanning the file. The Cues
  SeekPosition is patched in `write_trailer` once the real Cues offset
  is known; if no packets were written, the Cues slot is rewritten as
  a Void so the SeekHead doesn't point at offset 0.
- demux: parse `Chapters` master element — chapter atoms now surface in
  `Demuxer::metadata()` as `chapter:N:start_ms` / `chapter:N:end_ms` /
  `chapter:N:title` keys (ns→ms, 1-indexed).
- demux: parse `Attachments` — `AttachedFile` entries surface as
  `attachment:N:filename` / `:mime_type` / `:size_bytes`. Payload bytes
  are skipped via seek (no allocation), so a multi-megabyte embedded
  font no longer pulls a copy into RAM just to read its filename.
- codec_id: map Matroska subtitle CodecIDs (`S_TEXT/UTF8`, `S_TEXT/SSA`,
  `S_TEXT/ASS`, `S_TEXT/WEBVTT`, `S_TEXT/USF`, `S_VOBSUB`, `S_HDMV/PGS`,
  `S_HDMV/TEXTST`, `S_DVBSUB`, `S_KATE`) to short oxideav codec ids
  both ways, so subtitle tracks no longer pass through as
  `mkv:S_TEXT/UTF8` opaque ids.

### Fixed

- demux: subtitle tracks (TrackType=17) now surface with
  `MediaType::Subtitle` rather than `MediaType::Data`. Downstream
  filtering / probing tools that key on `media_type == Subtitle` can
  now find them.

## [0.0.5](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mkv/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5) - 2026-04-25

- bump oxideav-core / oxideav-codec dep examples to "0.1"
- bump to oxideav-core 0.1.1 + codec 0.1.1
- migrate register() to CodecInfo builder
- bump oxideav-core + oxideav-codec deps to "0.1"
- delegate codec-id lookup to CodecResolver (registry-backed)
- thread &dyn CodecResolver through open()

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mkv/compare/v0.0.3...v0.0.4) - 2026-04-18

### Other

## [0.0.3](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mkv/releases/tag/v0.0.3) - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- fix all clippy warnings for CI -D warnings gate

### Other

- rewrite README to match what the crate actually does

- implement seek_to via Cues index
- promote WebM to first-class — separate fourcc + muxer DocType + codec whitelist
- detect format by content probe, not by file extension
- surface metadata + duration_micros across all containers
- scaffold decoder — 3 headers + Huffman trees + packet classify
- RFC 9043 v3 slice layout + CRC-32 parity; ffmpeg→us decodes
- add lossless video codec — bit-exact self-roundtrip, RFC 9043 v3
- add rustfmt + clippy gates; release: macOS universal binary
- add Matroska (MKV) container + Opus crate + proper Ogg header handling
